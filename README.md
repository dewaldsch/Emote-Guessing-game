for the one labed ***UPDATED EMOTE GUESSING GAME*** you have to Make

people join with the command:

***(that way people can still chat in the Twitch chat, also with no more|
worry about Button ID's for the Updated one and will only put 
chat in 5 second slow mode)***

***!join***

or 

***!Join***

and if they wanna stop checking for the emote use the command
